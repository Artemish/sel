# SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION-LIBRARY

The SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION-LIBRARY enables the programmatic modification
and evaluation of extant software.

A common interface abstracts over multiple types of software objects
including abstract syntax trees parsed from source code (C/C++ support
using Clang), compiled assembler, and linked ELF binaries.  Mutation
and evaluation methods are implemented on top of this interface
supporting automation of common software engineering tasks through
Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) techniques.
