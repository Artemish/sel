SEL is a Lisp @emph{package}, in essence, a container for symbols allowing
the creation of seperate namespaces within a program. By default,
functions/variables defined within SEL are private to the package; to
export the symbol for use outside the package, it must be added to the
@code{:export} list in package.lisp. If the symbol is not exported and an
attempt to utilize it outside the package is made, an undefined symbol
error will result.
