The =*population*= is a global variable holding a list of evolving
software variants.  The evolutionary computation functions operate
directly on the =*population*= through the "population functions".
Exposure of the population through a global variable enables the user
to initialize the population in any way, and allows external functions
to monitor and interact with the population during evolution.  For
example [distributed.lisp] enables sharing of individuals between
multiple instances of evolution through two "sharing" functions which
interact with the =*population*= variable directly.

Each software variant is an object whose class is a sub-class of the
general =software= class.  New representations are implemented through
sub-classing =software= and customizing the generic "software
functions" where necessary.

Parameterization of the EC algorithm is done through setting global
variables and through arguments to the =evolve= function.

2 Usage 
========
Licensed under the GPLV3, see the [COPYING] file in this directory for
more information.

1. Available using git from [github].

2. To begin, =cd= into the =test/gcd= directory and look around.
   $ ls -1
   gcd.c                   # <- original program
   gcd.s                   # <- compiled from gcd.c with gcc -S gcd.c
   repair-asm.lisp         # <- options to repair
   test.sh*                # <- test script used to exercise gcd variants

3. Repairs may be performed from an interactive lisp session, for
   example, through evaluating the forms in [repair-asm.lisp].

4. Running =make= in this directory will build a =soft-ev= command
   line utility allowing repair to be scripted from the command line
   using simple configuration files.  The help message of the
   =soft-ev= command line utility serves as a template configuration
   file.

5. Distributed evolution between multiple lisp process on one or many
   machines is enabled using the [∅MQ] socket library.  Additionally,
   because population initialization is left to the user, distributed
   EC algorithms may also be implemented externally.  See
   [second-run.lisp] for an example configuration file using an incoming
   population.
